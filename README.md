# Manuscript for my bachelor thesis

**Title**: Characterizing the dynamics of a *Drosophila* motoneuron model via bifurcation analysis

Final version in [bachelor-thesis.pdf](bachelor-thesis.pdf). Code and data in [jrieke/drosophila-dynamics](https://github.com/jrieke/drosophila-dynamics). Handed in at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg on 12 January 2016. 

The thesis was written in [ScholarlyMarkdown](http://scholarlymarkdown.com/Scholarly-Markdown-Guide.html) and converted to LaTex/PDF via [scholdoc](http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com/) and xelatex. The ``postprocess.py`` script manipulates the intermediate ``bachelor-thesis.tex`` file to allow short figure/table captions directly in markdown. Use ``makedpdf.bat`` on Windows to run the complete conversion. Note: In the final version, manual edits were done in the ``bachelor-thesis.tex`` file before conversion to PDF (some things from the short figure captions were removed).
